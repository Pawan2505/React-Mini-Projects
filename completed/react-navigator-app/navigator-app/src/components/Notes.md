To build a Navigator App in ReactJS, we'll create a navigation system that allows users to switch between different "pages" or components without refreshing the entire page. We'll use React Router to achieve this, as it allows us to define routes and easily navigate between them.


<!-- Steps to Build a Navigator App: -->
1. Set Up React App with React Router.
2. Create Different Components (Home, About, Contact).
3. Set Up Navigation Links.
4. Define Routes for Navigation.
5. Run the Application.


<!-- Step 1: Set Up React App -->

npx create-react-app navigator-app
cd navigator-app


<!--Step 2: Install react-router-dom to handle routing: -->

npm install react-router-dom

<!--Step 3: Once installed, open the project in your code editor. -->
