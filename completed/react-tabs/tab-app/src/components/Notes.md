To build a Tab App in ReactJS, we will create a dynamic tab navigation component that switches between different content sections when a tab is clicked. This will involve using state to track which tab is active and conditionally rendering content based on the active tab.

<!-- Key Concepts: -->
State Management: We will use React's useState hook to track the currently selected tab.
Conditional Rendering: We will conditionally display content based on the active tab.
Reusable Components: Tabs and tab content will be managed using components for clean and modular code.
